It's gonna show you almost everything which can help you during leveling process at early stages of your new characters, and became more strict after you hit **lvl 80+** (select your lootfilter level in-game settings to adjust it more for your needs)

## Mid Season X Update:

![S10_update2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a0485dd-18b6-481c-9a99-23b1e55acdb2)

What's new?
- Added information on Magic and Rare Crafting bases, that will show Craft ALVL from now on.
	- High Craft ALVL Values gonna be highlighted in 3 tiers:
		1. ORANGE color - Can Roll All Affixes,
  		2. YELLOW color - Can Roll Most Affixes - Can't roll all of them, but you still might want to craft it, cause it can roll well,
  		3. TEAL color - Good for +Skills Affixes - It's designed for class items that can roll +Skills - For Caster recipes (Can't roll the highest affixes, but this shouldn't be an issue for caster weapon),
   		4. Low Craft ALVL values gonna be just displayed without any extra information.
- Revisieted Upgrading items section:
	- Added info with Value of Level Requirement after item being upgraded,
	- Added coloring of Required stat Values - When your character doesn't meet creteria, values would be displayed in RED color. When it meet the req, it will be in WHITE. 
		- <s>(In some cases it might display required level in Light Red/Coral color - When LEVELREQ before upgrade is higher, then LVLREQ of upgraded base - Then Filter can't evaluate the right RED/WHITE color, becouse of limitation with comparation "LEVELREQ>CLVL" that is not supported for now.)</s> - I managed to find workaround, all should be good now.
- Some other minor changes:
	- Highlights of some unique items reduced/improved slightly,
	- Highlights of crafting bases is now based on ALVL/CRAFTALVL instead of ILVL,
	- Rare Class items will show for all classes on Strict Filter Level (and still would be hidden if don't match your class on Max-Strict filter Level),
	- High ED with CTC Amp damage Weapon higlight description changed slightly,
	- Added some new +skills RW bases to be displayed,
	- Fixed spelling od NMAG Hierophant Trophy (was h-EI-rophant trophy before),
	- Added correct descriptions on Lucion Uber ingredients,
	- In Previous update you might notice the extra info for ReRolling Rare Jewels,
	- Some other fixes and improvements here and there.

- Some other fixes/improves here and there,

## Season IX Update:

![S9 update](https://github.com/Kryszard-POD/Kryszard-s-PD2-Loot-Filter/assets/63604590/6ebcd8be-9e69-4604-ac2a-61ae16b46562)

This update is one of the biggest in history, even if it will not feel very different from your - gamers perspective. Most of the code has been re-visited and optimised/adjusted even more then it was before. There is still some places for improvements, so I'll do my best to provide you the best quality filter I can - Bringing some more updates during the season.

Changelog:
- Item descriptions adjusted more by using new %CL% keyword instead of %NL% - This one is to prevent extra empty description lines to appear when they shouldn't - It never was an issue in my filter, but thanks to it I was able to remove ~40 lines with conditions where description line should break and when not. Now it's much easier to mange it (Big thanks to BetweenWalls and Kanzeon for that!),
- New Filter Level implemented - "Strict Filter - w/o Potions" - This one is set to be like regular "Strict Filter" but in addition it's hiding all health and mana potions, leaving just Juvies,
- Difference between "Strict Filters" and "Max-Strict Filter" is more noticable now - Mostly when it comes to RW bases and Chat Notifies about them,
- Possible Unique items will be listed on Gheed's Event screen from now (divided into Tier Levels - Norm/Exc/Elite),
- Added Notes about Guaranteed Stats of Crafted Items on both: Craft Infusions and Keys stacks with Quantity between 20-26,
- Visual Changes: 
	- PD2 "Pick Up"-Tagged items will be displayed with correct "*-stars" colors now (It should be like this from previous season, but I didn't notice it stays with same coloring as LoD items).
	- Added better highlights for Unique Horadric Tomes and Skeleton Key,
	- Superior items with ED tags color changed to New avaliable options:
		- Weapons - "Sup" color changed from RED to CORAL (light red) - Percentage values on high-tier items will stay in RED.
		- Armors - "Sup" color changed from BLUE to TEAL (light blue-ish) - Percentage values on high-tier items will stay in BLUE.
	- Removed displayed Quantity on Quivers - Those will be displayed as "x  Arrows  x" if MAG or RARE from now on.
	- +SKILLS staffmods will be highlighted a little bit more when roll with max +3 value (+1/+2 will appear with TAN "+" sign and LIGHT_GRAY "number value", while +3 will be displayed with ORANGE "+" sign and "YELLOW" "number value".
	- 3-signs Skill Names Abbreviations color when it match your class changed from ORANGE to SAGE (light green). If those are for other classes it will stay in DARK_GREEN as before. This will work also with Daggers, which can be spawn with both: Necromancer and Assassin skills at the same time.
- Fixed an issue, where Holy Freeze and Holy Fire skills has the same "HFR" abbreviations - Holy Freeze switched to "HFZ" from now on,
- Fixed an issue with abbreviation of "Poison Strike" skill which is "PST" now - It was "PDG" as Poison Dagger before,
- Goblin Toes highlighting reduced a little (but still noticable),
- Added better highlighting for good SET Etheral Weapons,
- Added chat notify for Skull Collector,
- White Etheral Throwing Weapons for Imbue/Crafting will be shown up to Filter Level 3 with chat notify up to Filter Level 2 (or up to Filter Level 5 with chat notify up to Filter Level 3 when your class is Barbarian) - Which means those are no longer visible on Strict Filters,
- Etheral Magic Necro Heads removed for filter levels 2+,
- MAG/RARE Daggers added since those can roll Staffmods now (with similar logic between filter levels as other staffmods-able items),
- Grand Matron Bows and its lower tiers will be displayed on all Filter levels now (caused by popularity of safety bows crafts),
- Highlights with DARK_GREEN *-star and chat notify of non-superior high-def RW bases removed (caused by general Defense values on body armors change),
- NMAG Chest Armors considered as good RW bases will be shown as all Elite Tiers - with adjusted +ED Values and Chat Notify messages between filter levels - also as few NORM and EXC tier bases if someone is hunting not only for highest DEF values but also their favourite skin options,
- Added a Note on RW Bases about Aviability of RW Recipes on Keys Stacks,
- Whole RuneWord Section has been re-visited and re-wrote to adjust filtering experience even more - There was too many changes to list in this small note, but trust me - It should be even better now! (if you will notice that some bases are missing, or some of them should be moved to lower filter levels let me know),
- Added a Dynamic Note with info that 2 x Half Freeze Duration sources will provide Cannot Be Frozen - It will help you to track your currently using Anti-Freezing sources.
- Added "notice me" Notes on Combo of 250+ED weapons with any Amp CTC proc,
- Added "notice me" Notes on High Lower Resist CTC proc items,
- "Notice me" notes adjusted to be less distractive on some common things like just CTC items or items with Charges,

- Health/Mana Potions Notes about Crafting recipes moved to Chipped/Square Gems instead,
- Some other adjustments and fixes here and there... :)

## Season VI Update:
General changes:

**Q, PB and C** - stands for Larzuk Quest, PuzzleBox and Corruption
Changed to:
**L, P and C** - stands for Larzuk Quest(and Larzuk Mallus - magic items will still show value of 2 sockets, but you need to know that Larzuk Mallus will give always 1 socket, mechanism is diffrent then Larzuk Quest - Larzuk Mallus description shows correct value of possible sockets which is 1), P is for Puzzle(Piece/Box) and C for Corruption,

## Season V Update:
I made 5 strictness levels, which you can choose directly from in-game settings menu:

* 0 - Show All Items - Default setup for all Filters - Like it say's, It gonna show you every garbage.
* 1 - Hide Just Trash Items - Clear your screen a little bit, hide just junk items
* 2 - Item Filter - More Notify - This one is classic Item.Filter that you all know and love, but with extra notifies for more items - all uniques and sets, low runes, flawlesses etc.
* 3 - Item Filter - Recommended - Classic Filter that most of us were using to this day :) I Recommend you use it, or use option 1 for first days of the ladder.
* 4 - Strict Filter - Something like my current strict filter, but with super health and mana potions
* 5 - Max-Strictness Filter - For EndGame Maniac Farmers - Should show just good stuff.

Those Strict Levels are not perfect for now (but should be fine), and we need to balance them to suit most of our needs, so I really want to hear your feedback.

There is also a change for Crafting Recipes descriptions. I've decided to transfer them from items to Perfect Gems instead. It gonna make our Items much Cleaner and Better! QoL Descriptions updated, all new Items and Runewords Supported!
I would describe it more, but don't have much time lately.
Please report any bugs you gonna notice. I need your Feedback to make it better.

![SeasonV.1](https://i.redd.it/o022vrzios891.png "SeasonV.1")  
![SeasonV.2](https://i.redd.it/saodw48and891.png "SeasonV.2")
![SeasonV.3](https://i.redd.it/4666g25zbeb91.png "SeasonV.3")

Below description is outdated, but filter works still on similar behaviour.

## Some Filter Features:

* Filter adds a lot of **useful NOTES** in item descriptions *(like crafting formulas, socketing and upgrading recipes, possible runewords, usability info etc.)*.  
* Inferior items are always hidden *(except for useful class items with +skills)*.  
* Filter is showing exactly +skills values on all NMAG items, even when item is on the ground *(so you don't have to pick those up to check +skills on them)*.
* Filter highlight useful vendor items to make those easier to catch *(like +3 to Warcries Weapons, Teleport Charges staves, Life Tap Charges wands, +3skill/+20IAS gloves, Trap Claws, etc.)*.  
* Every MAG and RARE WEAPON or ARMOR displays a PRICETAG only when its IDENTIFIED *(so you can know if its wotrh to visit Charsi)*.  
* Good CHARMS have changed names to make those easier to mule and organise in your inventory. *(for e.g. +1 to Warcries Grand Charm gonna be called "Warcries Skiller")*.
* hp and mana potions which are showing on screen depends of difficulty of your game. You gonna see every potions on normal diff. On nightmare only Great +, and on hell only Super and Juvies *(and antidotes)*. Showing gems depends of game difficulty aswell. Perfect Gems drop with chat notify.  
* Gold piles with low amount of gold are hidden  
* You can see most of the items and runeword bases when you are on low lvl. Items gonna dissapear when your character gain more lvls. You gonna see every white item *(RW base)* to lvl 30. Normal tier runeword bases gonna be hidden when you hit lvl 30+. Then you will still see every runeword base *(exceptional and elite tier ones)* until you hit **lvl 80+**. Similar rule counts with every magic/rare item will be shown until you hit **lvl 80+** *(normal tier ones only to lvl 40)*.  

## "EndGame" experience starts when you hit lvl 80+, then:

* Filter will show you only good runeword bases. *(check supported RW bases below)*  
* You gonna see exactly ED values on superior RW bases, exactly RES values on Paladin shields RW bases, exactly +skills values on Class-Specific RW bases.
* You will be able to see magic and rare: Circlets and Class Items like Barb Helms, Druid Pelts, Sorc Globes, Wands, Assasin Claws, Amazon Javelins and:  
* Rare gloves, boots and belts (and since rares are better then in LoD also chests, helmets and shields) and:  
* Every ETH Rare and Magic WEAPONS, and:
* Good magical bases for crafting, and:  
* Potentially expensive (Woth some GOLD) items are shown with a PRICETAG, like 2square in eq throwables, wands, sorc orbs etc.  
* Gold piles only in stacks **5k+**  
* Good Uniques (only when UNID!) will be shown with Chat Notification, Minimap Pin and extra colorful ** **STARS** **, the Best Uniques with extra green note. *(pick up!)*
* Runes Number colors 1-14 and 16-17 TAN, 15 and 18-19 WHITE with extra TAN *, 20-25 RED with extra RED * and chat notification, and 26+ GREEN with extra wide-box with COLORFUL ** **STARS** ** . *(to build some hype)*
* New PD2 items like: WorldStone Shards, Larzuk Puzzleboxes, Maps, DClone parts, etc. are included.

## Supported RuneWord bases:

*List coming soon. Meanwhile you can test it using [FilterBird Tool](https://betweenwalls.github.io/filterbird/?v=PD2).*
