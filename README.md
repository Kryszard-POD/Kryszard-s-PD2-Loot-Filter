# About
I am trying to make one filter, which will suit most players needs.  
Filter is good for both: leveling and endgame experience.  
It's gonna show you almost everything which can help you during leveling process at early stages of your new characters, and became more strict after you hit **lvl 80+**

## Season V Update!:
I made 5 strictness levels, which you can choose directly from in-game settings menu:

* 0 - Show All Items - Default setup for all Filters - Like it say's, It gonna show you every garbage.
* 1 - Hide Just Trash Items - Clear your screen a little bit, hide just junk items
* 2 - Item Filter - More Notify - This one is classic Item.Filter that you all know and love, but with extra notifies for more items - all uniques and sets, low runes, flawlesses etc.
* 3 - Item Filter - Recommended - Classic Filter that most of us were using to this day :) I Recommend you use it, or use option 1 for first days of the ladder.
* 4 - Strict Filter - Something like my current strict filter, but with super health and mana potions
* 5 - Max-Strictness Filter - For EndGame Maniac Farmers - Should show just good stuff.

Those Strict Levels are not perfect for now (but should be fine), and we need to balance them to suit most of our needs, so I really want to hear your feedback.

There is also a change for Crafting Recipes descriptions. I've decided to transfer them from items to Perfect Gems instead. It gonna make our Items much Cleaner and Better! QoL Descriptions updated, all new Items and Runewords Supported!
I would describe it more, but don't have much time lately.
Please report any bugs you gonna notice. I need your Feedback to make it better.

![SeasonV.2](https://i.redd.it/saodw48and891.png "SeasonV.2")

Below description is outdated, but filter works still on similar behaviour.

## Some Filter Features:

* Filter adds a lot of **useful NOTES** in item descriptions *(like crafting formulas, socketing and upgrading recipes, possible runewords, usability info etc.)*.  
* Inferior items are always hidden *(except for useful class items with +skills)*.  
* Filter is showing exactly +skills values on all NMAG items, even when item is on the ground *(so you don't have to pick those up to check +skills on them)*.
* Filter highlight useful vendor items to make those easier to catch *(like +3 to Warcries Weapons, Teleport Charges staves, Life Tap Charges wands, +3skill/+20IAS gloves, Trap Claws, etc.)*.  
* Every MAG and RARE WEAPON or ARMOR displays a PRICETAG only when its IDENTIFIED *(so you can know if its wotrh to visit Charsi)*.  
* Good CHARMS have changed names to make those easier to mule and organise in your inventory. *(for e.g. +1 to Warcries Grand Charm gonna be called "Warcries Skiller")*.
* hp and mana potions which are showing on screen depends of difficulty of your game. You gonna see every potions on normal diff. On nightmare only Great +, and on hell only Super and Juvies *(and antidotes)*. Showing gems depends of game difficulty aswell. Perfect Gems drop with chat notify.  
* Gold piles with low amount of gold are hidden  
* You can see most of the items and runeword bases when you are on low lvl. Items gonna dissapear when your character gain more lvls. You gonna see every white item *(RW base)* to lvl 30. Normal tier runeword bases gonna be hidden when you hit lvl 30+. Then you will still see every runeword base *(exceptional and elite tier ones)* until you hit **lvl 80+**. Similar rule counts with every magic/rare item will be shown until you hit **lvl 80+** *(normal tier ones only to lvl 40)*.  

## "EndGame" experience starts when you hit lvl 80+, then:

* Filter will show you only good runeword bases. *(check supported RW bases below)*  
* You gonna see exactly ED values on superior RW bases, exactly RES values on Paladin shields RW bases, exactly +skills values on Class-Specific RW bases.
* You will be able to see magic and rare: Circlets and Class Items like Barb Helms, Druid Pelts, Sorc Globes, Wands, Assasin Claws, Amazon Javelins and:  
* Rare gloves, boots and belts (and since rares are better then in LoD also chests, helmets and shields) and:  
* Every ETH Rare and Magic WEAPONS, and:
* Good magical bases for crafting, and:  
* Potentially expensive (Woth some GOLD) items are shown with a PRICETAG, like 2square in eq throwables, wands, sorc orbs etc.  
* Gold piles only in stacks **5k+**  
* Good Uniques (only when UNID!) will be shown with Chat Notification, Minimap Pin and extra colorful ** **STARS** **, the Best Uniques with extra green note. *(pick up!)*
* Runes Number colors 1-14 and 16-17 TAN, 15 and 18-19 WHITE with extra TAN *, 20-25 RED with extra RED * and chat notification, and 26+ GREEN with extra wide-box with COLORFUL ** **STARS** ** . *(to build some hype)*
* New PD2 items like: WorldStone Shards, Larzuk Puzzleboxes, Maps, DClone parts, etc. are included.

## Supported RuneWord bases:

Tweaked for [Futureal](https://www.twitch.tv/futureal) - Less colorful, more Vanilla looking version of the filter. No more "colorful *STARS*" and "PICK UP" things.
Few small changes compararing to orginal item.filter, but still almost the same functianolity and QoL features.
